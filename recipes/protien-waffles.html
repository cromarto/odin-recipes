    <header>Detailed Cooking Steps</header>
    <p>*please note you should stir the mix as often as possible in these steps to avoid
        pockets of unstired mix.*
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add two large scoops of protein powder and creatine.
            I use the scooping devices the protein and creatine come with.
        </li>
        <li>Add a bunch of Protein Pancake Mix.</li>
        <li>Then add the canned pumpkin, chocolate chips, brown sugar, salt, and frozen blueberries.
        </li>
        <li>In a blender add 2-3 bananas with milk and blend. Add contents to bowl.</li>
        <li>Lastly add milk or water to the mix and stir.
            The consistency is up to you, if you want denser waffles add less liquid,
            if you want fluffier airier waffles add more liquid.
        </li>
        <li>Heat up a waffle iron/griddle/maker and scoop 1 cup of batter onto the cooking
            element. Let cook for 8min.
        </li>
        <li>Place cooked waffles on large baking tray once finished.
            Move the waffle to the side when the next one is ready to be layed down.
            Make sure to use a paper towel to wipe off the condensation each time, 
            this ensures the waffles don't get soggy and remain crispy.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
