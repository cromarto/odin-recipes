    <header>Description</header>
    <p>This recipe is affordable, delicious and healthy. I use a pressure cooker as it
        makes cooking so much easier, but you can use a pot on the stove, you just have
        to stir a lot to keep it from burning on the bottom. Steel cut oats digest slower, 
        giving you a nice steady stream of energy and making you feel full for longer.
    </p>
    <p>You meal prep this and are able to eat quickly throughout the week. A great filling
        breakfast, I like to add my <a href="./protien-waffles.html" target="_blank">Protein Waffles</a> on top of my oatmeal.
    </p>
    <p>You also might start to notice I like canned pumpkin quite a bit, the taste isn't
        really noticale to me, it's quite mild, but it's health benifits are amazing.
        If your building muscle or training, canned pumpkin aids in keeping the proteins in
        your body from oxidizing (Protein Carbonylation). Therefore aids in recovery. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/athleanx/reel/CzXyot2sVcx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn More about canned pumpkin.</a>
